üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview

This repository documents the Enterprise 101 (E101) core section from ProjectSecurity.io, where I designed, built, attacked, and defended a small, virtualized enterprise network known as "ProjectX."

The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on, end-to-end experience in both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) security within a realistic Active Directory environment.

Key Outcomes:

Successfully deployed and managed a multi-OS virtual network using a defined enterprise topology.

Implemented a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for continuous monitoring.

Executed a multi-stage cyber attack, from initial access to data exfiltration.

Developed custom detection rules and performed incident response to identify and contain the simulated threat.

üèõÔ∏è Lab Topology and Technologies

The ProjectX network was segmented and managed using VirtualBox (or VMware) to simulate a modern corporate infrastructure.

Network Components

| **Virtual Machine (VM)** | **Role** | **Operating System/Tool** | **Purpose** | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| PROJECTX-AD | Domain Controller (DC) | Windows Server 2025 | Centralized identity management (Active Directory) and DNS resolution. | 
| PROJECTX-W11 | Windows Workstation | Windows 11 Enterprise | Simulates a primary user endpoint. Used for phishing and vulnerability exploitation. | 
| PROJECTX-LINUX | Corporate Workstation | Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 | Simulates a secondary user endpoint. | 
| PROJECTX-SEC | Security Server (SIEM) | Ubuntu Server 22.04 + **Wazuh** | Security Information and Event Management, collecting logs from all endpoints via agents. | 
| PROJECTX-NETMON | Network Monitoring | **Security Onion** | Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and network log analysis. | 
| ATTACKER-VM | Offensive Machine | **Kali Linux** | Used to execute the simulated cyber attack chain. | 
| Corporate Services | Email/Web Sandbox | **MailHog** | Simulates an internal email server for intercepting phishing attempts. | 

Core Skills Demonstrated

System Administration: Active Directory setup, Group Policy Object (GPO) configuration, DNS management.

Virtualization: Configuration of NAT and Internal/Host-Only networks for isolation and segmentation.

Log Management: Deployment and configuration of Wazuh agents and centralized log ingestion.

Incident Detection: Writing custom detection rules for specific attack techniques.

Offensive Security: Phishing, payload delivery, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.

üí• Cyber Attack Simulation (Red Team)

A full, end-to-end attack was conducted against the ProjectX environment, leveraging misconfigurations and vulnerable user interaction to compromise the domain. The phases mapped directly to the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

| **ATT&CK Phase** | **Technique (T-Code)** | **Summary of Action** | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| Initial Access | T1566 (Phishing) | Delivered a malicious file or link to the target user on the Windows 11 endpoint, resulting in initial execution. | 
| Execution | T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) | Executed a reverse shell payload using PowerShell to establish C2 communication. | 
| Lateral Movement | T1021 (Remote Services) | Used tools like **PsExec** or compromised credentials to move from the initial workstation to the Domain Controller (PROJECTX-AD). | 
| Privilege Escalation | T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) | Elevated user privileges on the DC to a Domain Administrator level. | 
| Exfiltration | T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) | Stole simulated "sensitive data" files from a corporate share, proving the breach objective was met. | 
| Persistence | T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) | Established a mechanism to maintain access in case of a system reboot or session termination. | 

üîé Incident Response and Detection (Blue Team)

The primary goal of the Blue Team component was to ensure the security stack could detect every phase of the Red Team simulation.

Wazuh Alert Triage: Monitored the Wazuh dashboard for high-severity alerts related to unauthorized process execution (PowerShell), new user creation, and suspicious remote logins.

Custom Rule Writing: Developed a custom rule to specifically detect the unique characteristics of the malicious payload used during the initial access phase, lowering the time-to-detection.

Log Investigation: Used Security Onion (Elastic Stack, Wireshark, Suricata) to analyze network traffic and system logs (Sysmon) from the endpoints to confirm the source, method, and scope of the compromise.

Remediation: Documented the steps required to quarantine the infected hosts, revoke compromised credentials, and deploy GPOs to prevent the attack vector from being used again.

üöÄ Future Enhancements (NA101 Integration)

This project serves as the foundation for future work. The immediate next steps include building off this topology for the Networks & Attacks 101 (NA101) course:

Integrating a dedicated firewall solution (e.g., pfSense) to implement network segmentation rules.

Deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) like Suricata to actively block network attacks.

Practicing advanced network-layer attacks (MiTM, DNS Spoofing).
