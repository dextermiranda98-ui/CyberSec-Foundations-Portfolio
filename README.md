üõ°Ô∏è CyberSec Foundations Portfolio: My Transition into Digital Defense
Context: From Warehouse Logistics to Cyber Security
This repository is a live portfolio detailing my transition into the field of cybersecurity. After spending several years managing physical logistics in a warehouse environment, I realized my passion for problem-solving and systematic organization translated directly to digital security.

This portfolio begins with the foundational knowledge and practical labs completed after successfully finishing the ProjectSecurity.io Enterprises E101 Course. My goal is to demonstrate competency in fundamental security principles and show continuous growth as I move toward more complex roles like SOC Analyst or Penetration Tester.

üéØ Repository Goal
The primary purpose of this repository is to track and demonstrate practical application of entry-level security skills. It serves as a centralized place for:

Documenting practical lab work and findings.

Storing basic scripting solutions for security automation.

Organizing structured review notes on core concepts.

üìÅ Project Structure
This repository is organized into three primary areas reflecting core foundational skills:

Directory

Content Focus

Example Files/Labs

1-Networking-Demos

Practical analysis of network traffic and protocol behavior.

Wireshark .pcap files, documentation on TCP/IP handshake analysis, DNS query breakdown, and basic subnetting exercises.

2-Security-Scripting

Small, utility scripts written primarily in Python for common security tasks.

log_parser.py (Script to identify failed login attempts), password_checker.py (Basic script to evaluate password complexity).

3-E101-Review-Notes

Structured Markdown notes summarizing critical security frameworks and terminology.

OSI-Model-Summary.md, CIA-Triad-Deep-Dive.md, and summaries of common attack vectors (e.g., Phishing, DDoS).

üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies & Concepts Demonstrated
Networking: OSI Model, TCP/IP, Subnetting basics.

Tools: Wireshark, Basic Command Line Interface (CLI) usage.

Scripting: Python (specifically file handling, regex, and basic logic).

Concepts: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad), Access Control, Vulnerability vs. Threat.

Version Control: Git & GitHub.

üå± Future Development
As I continue my studies and gain certifications, I plan to expand this portfolio with:

Incident Response Playbooks: Draft documentation for handling basic security incidents.

Honeypot Analysis: Setting up and analyzing traffic captured by a simple digital honeypot.

Cloud Security Basics: Introducing infrastructure-as-code (IaC) templates for secure cloud deployments.
