Subject: URGENT: Mandatory MFA Policy Enrollment Requirement - Action Required by 5 PM Today

Dear ProjectX User,

Effective immediately, ProjectX is deploying an updated Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system across all corporate endpoints to comply with new regulatory mandates. This update is critical for mitigating escalating phishing risks.

ACTION REQUIRED:

Your account is currently flagged as non-compliant. To avoid immediate suspension of remote access privileges and to ensure seamless transition, you must process the policy update today.

Open the attached document, "MFA_Enrollment_Mandate.docx".

Follow the embedded instructions to process your credential synchronization token.

The process requires elevated system permissions to register the new security provider DLLs. Please ensure you allow all prompts. Failure to complete this process by 5:00 PM EST will result in your endpoint being temporarily locked for mandatory security patching.

Thank you for your immediate compliance with this critical security mandate.

ProjectX Security Operations Team
